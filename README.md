## SMFile_Writer
###### Stepmania File Writer for the [Stepmania Note Generator](https://github.com/cpuguy96/stepmania-note-generator) by cpuguy96 for [Stepmania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm) by VR0. Used in conjunction with the [Stepmania File Parser](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Parser). Converts all .txt file generated by either [Stepmania File Parser](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Parser) or [Stepmania Note Generator](https://github.com/cpuguy96/stepmania-note-generator) to .sm files playable by Stepmania.

#### Usage:

- Place the output files into the input folder and run the script. The default input folder is writeIn.
- Successfully converted files will be generated in the output folder. The default output folder is writeOut.
- If different folders are used, specify them by appending `--input inputfolder` and/or `--output outputfolder`.
        Example: `python smfile_writer.py --input inputfolder --output outputfolder`

###### If either arguments are not specified, the scripts uses the default folder where none is specified.
###### If the specified input folder is not found, the script will print an error and terminate.
###### If the specified output folder is not found, the script will automatically generate the missing folder.
