## SMFile_Writer
#### Stepmania File Writer for the [Stepmania Note Generator](https://github.com/cpuguy96/stepmania-note-generator) by cpuguy96 for [Stepmania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania/wiki/sm) by VR0. Used in conjunction with the [Stepmania File Parser](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Parser) by me

Batch processes all .txt file generated by either [Stepmania File Parser](https://github.com/jhaco/SMFile_Parser) or [Stepmania Note Generator](https://github.com/cpuguy96/stepmania-note-generator) in the current directory of smfile_writer.py into .sm files usable by Stepmania

#### changelog (top-new):
- corrected from 1/192th notes to 1/256th notes
- fixed a bug where notes that intersect multiple measures appeared in both measures, resulting in extra notes

#### plans:
- be able to compress 1/192nd measures down to 1/64th, 1/32nd, 1/16th and so on

#### issues:
- ~~timing offset causes inaccuracies, will need a way to include that in all generated .txt files~~ Resolved in SMFile_Parser
